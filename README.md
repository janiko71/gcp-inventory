# gcp-inventory
Inventory of GCP resources

## Pre-requisite

https://cloud.google.com/python/setup?hl=fr

```pip install google-cloud-asset``` (en bÃªta)
```pip install google-api-python-client```
```pip install google-api-helper```

```gcloud components install app-engine-python```

See documentatoion on https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-asset/

Else you'll have to install all needed packages ```pip install google-cloud-storage``` ??

**All APIs** for the services on which you want information **must be enabled**, as well as Cloud Resources Manager API. And the service account you'll use needs to have all the needed **authorizations** (viewer on all the services you are inventoring on all projects you want to inventory).

### Homepage and API docs

## Pagination
https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/master/docs/pagination.md
Looks like it's useless with json return format :S

## Authentication
https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/auth.html

Google says that using a service account is a better solution than enduser credentials (Google SDK user), because of possible API quota limitation.

Tip: Don't use quotes in ```set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./file.json```! 

In Visual Studio Code, use ```launch.json``` to set the authentication like that:
```{

    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python : Fichier actuel",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "env": {
                "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS":"./cred.json"
            }
        }
    ]
}```
